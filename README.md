OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this mini project is to create a distance measurement system using an Arduino microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor module. We aim to measure distances within a defined range, typically 2 cm to 200 cm, with precision and real-time feedback. By implementing the fundamental principles of ultrasonic distance sensing, including pulse generation, signal propagation, and echo reception, we intend to offer an affordable and versatile solution for applications like obstacle avoidance, robotics, and automation. The project will be comprehensively documented, encompassing hardware setup, Arduino code, and an accessible user interface for distance data visualization. Practical experiments will be conducted to demonstrate the system's reliability and precision, with a focus on promoting electronic, programming, and sensor integration knowledge among students and hobbyists. This project also encourages further customization and exploration, potentially leading to enhancements or specialized applications in specific domains.
